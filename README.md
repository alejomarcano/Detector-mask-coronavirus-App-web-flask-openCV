=====================

The objective of this project is to train a deep learning model to detect whether or not a person wears a face mask or mask. One of the challenges of this project is getting a data set of people with masks. I explain who created this dataset and how it was used throughout the post.

I relied on Adrian Rosebrock COVID-19's post and code: Face Mask Detector with OpenCV, Keras / TensorFlow, and Deep Learning. From there I did different tests and developed a web app, showing an OpenCV frame in HTML with Flask Python Framework.
